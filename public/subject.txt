Frontend - ReactJS
In this exercise you need to work with the ReactJS library.
The idea is to create a template similar to the example (example/template-example.png) with the assets we provide you :

images/
  background.jpg
  player1.png
  player2.png
  player3.png
  psg.png
  bastia.png

datas/data.json
  players
  teams
  games
  medias (obviously you can change the image path to fit your react application)

You don't need to render a png image or anything, just display your own template using react & css on a web page

You need to display on your template :
- player image (example : left image)
- player name (example : Aurier)
- team name (example : PARIS SG)
- team logo (example  bastia.png & psg.png)
- game score (example : 1 - 2)
- game date (example : not present on the visual)

Once you have it, you need to implement a setting form to make your data dynamic, for example :
a player <select /> (with the list of players found in data.json) :
  will change the player name & image on the template based on which player you choose

a game <select /> (with the list of games found in data.json) :
  will change the score/date of the game and the team's name/logo
